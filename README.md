## **Exam Scores Prediction**

The dataset contains test scores from three different subjects at a fictional public school. This dataset also contains variables about various personal and socio-economic factors for each student.

The goal is to provide an analysis on how several variables could affect a student's exam score and to predict future exam scores given those variables.
